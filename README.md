<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Cloay</h1>
<h3 align="center">A software engineer from Ohio</h3>

Most of my work is proprietary, but I use GitHub to sandbox and share what I'm learning outside of work. I'm a firm believer in having a well-rounded life, with interests outside of coding, so you won't find me on here often, but I recognize the importance of continuous learning, especially with technologies I don't have the opportunity to use at my full-time job. There, I use Java to develop a desktop application for medical professionals (with a little help from Mercurial, Phabricator, Gradle, Jenkins, and MongoDB).
